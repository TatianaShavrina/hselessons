### This is a project of Finnifh PropBank label model

I builded it on CRF, as this is a doog model for sequence labeling, where you can put a lot of layers of parallel sequences
It is also good for this task, as it can see the long-distance dependencies we have in the propbank

To reproduce my results, you will need to install these libraries:
 - pycrfsuite
 - conllu
 - requests
 - sklearn
 
 
Here you can find Jupyter notebook with all the code
And also saved models
